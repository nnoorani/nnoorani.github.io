As the primary designer and developer, I came up with the logo concept and design, the login screen design as well as the main app design. Additional features were also prototyped as can be seen on the details page. The app concept, minimum viable products, business model were pitched in less than 48 hours in front of a panel of judges, including the mayor of Waterloo. I developed the front-end for the app to be demo functional within the weekend and enhanced the design and concept in later days.">

As students working in Toronto and interested in the startup space, we found a disconnection amongst major players in the startup community and felt a lack of face-to-face interaction between startups and their audiences. We set out to help plan events to bring these two parties together. As we met with more people, we developed the idea further. Visit the details page to see our journey.

        The development of the site is an example of my expertise with CSS3 transitions and jQuery, as well as my ability to develop smooth and slick web interfaces.">

        <p>The Internet has become a giant pool of knowledge, opinions, and information. One thing that fascinates me most about the tech space is people's willingness to share and contribute. Open-source projects, meetups, clubs etc. - all focused around this idea of sharing knowledge and learning from those around you.</br></br>
          Blogging has always been one of those things I ran from. Putting my thoughts into words and then putting them on the Internet was nerve wracking. But after an amazing term at work, this fascination has pushed me forward to try yet another new endeavour. Enjoy, and let me know your thoughts.</p>
