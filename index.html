As students working in Toronto and interested in the startup space, we found a disconnection amongst major players in the startup community and felt a lack of face-to-face interaction between startups and their audiences. We set out to help plan events to bring these two parties together. As we met with more people, we developed the idea further. Visit the details page to see our journey.
