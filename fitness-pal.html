      <h1>My Fitness Pal</h1>
      <p class="m20top">
        Earlier this Fall (2014), I was looking for a way to improve my product design skills and processes. I wanted to
        venture into a project that would allow me to design something from end-to-end: research, testing, wireframing, prototyping - repeat.
        </br></br>
        As a frequent user of MyFitnessPal myself, I noticed a couple things I found frustratingly difficult and set out to find out whether other people felt the same way. I talked to many different types of users - frequent, short-term, long-term, and new users, and those who stopped using it for another alternative. Some findings were consistent across the board, while others provided new and different perspectives on the goals that users wished to achieve through the application.
      </p>
    </br></br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Common Findings from User Research</b></li>
        <li>1. Users were only using it to log calories eaten, and not as much for logging exercise. When asked why, many reported it was much more difficult to do so, especially within the web application.
        </li>
        <li>
          2. The application didn't help them work towards their goals. The weight progress is a small part of overall goals to improve fitness
        </li>
        <li>
          3. The home screen is a social feed and doesn't have anything relevant that users really wish to see.
        </li>
        <li>
          4. Users aren't motivated to return to the application to keep logging.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Goals</b></li>
        <li>1. Create motivation to retain users and get them to keep returning and logging</li>
        <li>2. Make exercise a more fundamental aspect of the application</li>
        <li>3. Improve prevalence of a user's goals and help them actively work towards them and see how they're doing</li>
        <li>4. Create a place where users can see an entire overview of their daily progress.</li>
        <li>5. Improve the feel of the app - feel good, do good.</li>
      </ul>
    </br>
      <p>Below are some mockups I came up with to help solve some of these issues - these are still a work in progress!</p>
      <div class="valign-top center">
        <b>Existing Design</b></br>
        <ul class="bxslider">
          <li><img src="css/images/existing-mfp-home.png" /></li>
          <li><img src="css/images/existing-mfp-add-food.png" /></li>
          <li><img src="css/images/existing-mfp-progress.png" /></li>
        </ul>

          <li><img src="css/images/Home Screen - Nov 5.png" /></li>
          <li><img src="css/images/Add Food - Nov 5.png" /></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Design Details</h4>
        <div class="col-xs-12">
          <b>The Home View</b>
          <p>The home screen was created into the Dashboard - help uses improve overall fitness and easily see where how they were doing relative to their goals on a particular day. It moves
          beyond just calories eaten to include exercise, and if the user pairs with a fitness device, steps they've taken.
          </p>
          <i>Goals addressed:</i>
          <p>1. Dashboard view</p>
          <p>2. Goal-oriented</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12">
          <b>The Add Food View</b>
          <p>Adding a food in the existing design seemed to not prominently give users a view of the important nutritional composition of the food. Users set goals in the existing onboarding flow for carb, fibre, protein and fat consumption a day, and those goals should consistently connect across the app.
          </p>
          <i>Goals addressed:</i>
          <p>1. Goal-oriented</p>
          <p>2. Look and feel</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12">
          <b>The Progress View</b>
          <p>The progress was relocated into a user's profile - a spot where all there progress can be tracked. This adds to the ability for a user to track their goals easily.
          </p>
          <i>Goals addressed:</i>
          <p>1. Goal-oriented</p>
          <p>2. Look and feel</p>
          <p>3. Motivation</p>
