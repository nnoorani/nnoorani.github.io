  <title>Google Maps Feature - My Projects</title>
  <div class="container main col-md-6 col-md-offset-3s">
    <h1 class="center">Maps Feature</h1>
    <p class="m20top">
      Have you ever been on the roadtrip and need to stop for gas? Or, perhaps, going out to eat and need to find parking nearby? If you are using Google Maps to navigate, the current experience is less than friendly. You need to exit out of your current route, search for your need nearby, and see a list or view of results. However, you've lost all context of where you're headed, so you have no idea of whether any of these places are on the way.
    </p>
    <p>I have come across this problem way too many times so I decided to think of a solution.</p>
    <div class="valign-top center">
      <ul class="bxslider">
        <li><img src="css/images/gmaps-home-screen.png"/></li>
        <li><img src="css/images/gmaps-search.png" /></li>
        <li><img src="css/images/gmaps-listresults.png" /></li>
        <li><img  src="css/images/gmaps-maps.png" /></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-12 m20 no-padding">
      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <b>The Directions View</b>
        <p>A new icon was added to the directions view which allows you to find locations on the route. The icon is located near the bottom right corner.
        </p>
        </br>
      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <b>The Search View</b>
        <p>Upon clicking the icon, the user is taken to a search view, similar to the one seen in the current Google Maps app. Key differences are the ability search where you are right now, or closer to your destination and that the directions for the route you are on continue to display.
        </p>
        </br>
      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <b>The Map View</b>
        <p>Once a user has searched what they are looking for on the way, they see these on the map in the context of their current route. Tooltips provide information on how much extra time will be added to their trip. This view shows the detour the driver or user will need to take.
        </p>
        </br>
      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <b>The List View</b>
        <p>This view shows much of the same information as the map view but in a more detailed format. It mimicks the existing List Results view in Google Maps. It shows additional information about the location itself, as well as the extra mileage the user will have to travel.
        </p>
