  <title>Minted Storefront Tools - My Projects</title>
  <div class="container">
    <h3 class="navigation">Minted: Storefront Tools</h3>
    <a class="styled-link linx-box-inverted center yellow" href="index.html">Back Home</a>
    <p>
      Minted is a design marketplace where I currently work. On Minted, there are designers who create art and submit it to contests. If they win, they are able to launch their art onto the site to sell. Designers at Minted have stores that showcase all their designs on the site. Currently, there is no way for a designer to customize how their storefront looks.
    </br>
      My project was to create a store tool that would introduce designers to some basic ability to edit their storefront. The initial functionality was to edit the items that appeared in their featured row in their stores.
    </p>
    </br>
    <div class="valign-top center">
      <b>How a Store Looks</b></br>

    </div>
    </br></br>

    <b>Requirements</b>
    <ul>
      <li>1.The user needs to be able to select three products from all their launched products to show in the first row of their stores.
      </li>
      <li>2. The user should be able to sort all their products by their category, winning or not winning, product name (alphabetically) and if they are featured or not.</li>
      <li>3. The tools must be flexible to allow for additional management abilities.</li>
      <li>3. The user needs to be able to change the positioning of the three items within the row.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Constraints</b>
    <ul>
      <li>1.The user should not be allowed to select more than 3 products.
      </li>
      <li>2. The design must conform to Minted's current design styleguide</li>
      <li></li>
      <li>2. The user should be able to sort all their products by their category, winning or not winning, product name (alphabetically) and if they are featured or not.</li>
      <li>3. The tools must be flexible to allow for additional management abilities.</li>

        <b>The Main View</b>
        <p>
          This view fulfills requirements of being able to see all your products and scroll through them easily. As many designers at Minted have hundreds of products, the final design has a table that infinitely scrolls and is not restricted by a smal, fixed height (see iteration #1). It uses existing styles at Minted to stay consistent with the brand.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
      <b>The Positioning Overlay</b>
      <p>Many ideas were explored of how designers could be given a preview of their chosen items and how they looked within the main view (see iteration #1 and #2). However, in the end, the final design incorporated a next button that allowed the user to position their items from an overlay.
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <b>The Error Dialog</b>
        <p>While this functionality is not ideal for the user as having to close dialogs can get frustrating, the requirement of only selecting three items was fulfilled by having a small dialog come up when the user tries to select a fourth item. The reason other ideas were not chosen was due to tradeoffs with Engineering time.
