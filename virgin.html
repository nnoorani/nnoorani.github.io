				<h2>Virgin Mobile MyBenefits App</h2>
				<h4 class="section-header">Project Overview</h4>
				<p>BNOTIONS was tasked with creating the Virgin Mobile MyBenefits applications for both Android and iOS. Virgin Mobile is a popular telecommunications brand known to appeal to and target millenials. Students probably recognize them for their popular 2-for-1 Cineplex promo, but the benefits of Virgin's mobile plans can get you looking fresh and traveling the world. <p>

				<p>The task at hand appeared simple: take the MyBenefits <a href="http://www.virginmobile.ca/en/members-lounge/index.html">website</a> and transform it into a mobile app that people can use to redeem their benefits in store. No more e-mail and print fiascos. <p>

				<p><b>My Role:</b> Product/UX Designer</p>
				<p><b>BNOTIONS Team: </b>Product Manager, 2 Visual Designers, UX/Product Designer, Android and iOS Dev teams</p>
				<p><b>Virgin Mobile Team: </b>IT, Marketing, Designers, Creative</p></br>

				<h4 class="section-header">Key Stakeholders</h4>
				<p>Virgin Mobile Customers: The benefits are a strong incentive to purchase a Virgin mobile plan, and most users forget about these after signing on. Users that do redeem offers often miss the chance to redeem before expiration date, or do not return to the website since they don't know when new offers are available.</p>

				<p>Virgin Mobile: The benefits are opportunities for Virgin Mobile to create partnerships with other brands. By increasing redemption rates on their benefits, Virgin Mobile has a stronger offering to new and existing offers, bringing in a greater revenue.</p>

				<p>Virgin Mobile Partners: The partners benefit from an improved experience through more exposure and better access to their deals. This not only helps their marketing efforts, but brings in more customers.</p> 

				<h4 class="section-header">Process</h3>	
				<p>
				<li>1. Deep Dive</li>
				We began with a deep dive with the Virgin Mobile team, to come to the root of the current problem. This helped our team get a sense of Virgin's goals for this project. </p>
				<p>
					<li>2. Gathering Information</li>
				From the deep dive and initial research, we were able to gather the goals, requirements and constraints from Virgin on our final solution. Some words thrown around here were:
				Delight, convenience, simplicity, excitement, awareness</p>

				<p>Requirements came mainly from Virgin's API infrastructure and the way content was currently structured. Our purpose in this segment was to come up with our goal or purpose for the app. </p>

				<p>The goal: To excite new, existing and potential users about the possibilities with Virgin Mobile by saving and redeeming offers by Virgin partners. </p>
				<p><li>3. Core features</li>
				Defining the essential features the app needed before diving into the details produced a clearer picture of what was to come. </p>

				<p>In order for users to browse and redeem offers, the following features were defined as core features/flows:
				<ul><li>Authentication with Virgin network</li>
				<li>Browsing available offers </li>
				<li>Viewing saved offers</li>
				<li>Allowing users to customize their app settings</li></ul>
				</p>

				<p><li>4. App map</li>
				Next, after reviewing the core features and flows with the Virgin team, we developed an app map. This allowed us to get a sense of the information architecture of the app, and how each core feature would connect to others. It established the kind of navigation we would need, where information would live, and how users would be able to access functions. </p>

				<p>The app map began as a high-level diagram. As the project progressed and we hashed out more details, the app map reflected finer and deeper levels of clarity and flows in the app. </p>

				</div>

				<p><li>5. Sketch, wireframe, create</li>
				By creating wireframes for each core feature at a time, and utilizing the app map to understand how items would connect, the project further developed. This process was extremely iterative - often, wireframes would bring new ideas</p>

				</div>

				<p><li>6. Iterate</li>
				Our UX design process was about 6 weeks long. Each week, we met with the Virgin team to review our progress, get feedback and explain our decisions. Once UX decisions were finalized, the project moved forward and became magical in the hands of the BNOTIONS visual designers.

				<h4 class="section-header">Challenges</h4>
				<p>With such a large team working on the project, keeping the project consistently up to date and responding promptly to feedback was a major challenge. Moreover, given the number of different disciplines involved in the feedback process, maintaining solid reasoning for UX and Product decisions was crucial. </p>

				<p>The drawbacks to such a large corporation project are the technical constraints that come with them. Many UX decisions were influenced by the Virgin IT team and feasibility on their part. </p>

				<p>This application had a pretty large feature set, and to be able to map the whole thing out and structure our files/project in a way where we could collaborate on all of these was difficult to get right. While these tasks seem small and trivial, the way a project is set up can sometimes make or break your workflow. My setup and prep for this project was definitely a major learning experience, but helped me improve my process for the rest of my time at BNOTIONS. </p>
